# MySQL-Sales-Insights

This project focuses on performing advanced SQL queries on a retail sales database that includes five interrelated tables: employees, orders, order_details, products, and suppliers. 
This project simulates a real-world business scenario where decision-making depends on data insights. From ranking employees to evaluating supplier performance, every query here reflects a practical need in operations, sales, or strategy.

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply SQL skills to a multi-table relational database.

* Solve real-world business questions related to employee performance, product demand, and supplier impact.

* Transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that support strategic decision-making.
